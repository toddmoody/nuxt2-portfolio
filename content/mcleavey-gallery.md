McLeavey Gallery operate a boutique Gallery in central Wellington and required a refreshed digital presence - with a focus on user experience. This involved a ground-up rethink of the layout and design, creating a seamless experience for the end-user whilst helping to facilitate sales leads.

In addition to the front-end, a number of enhancements were identified relating to the SilverStripe platform including updating to the latest stable release and updates to the database relationships to support the UX updates.

Lastly, to resolve a number of other pain points (including slow page load times) and boost SEO a devops phase was implemented including migrating from a slow and restrictive shared hosting platform to Amazon Web Services.

### Stack & approach

</div>
<div class="project__long__description__content">

To achieve the ultimate goal of improving the general UX, we kicked off by identifying current pain points and gaps in the current flow. Once I had a clear picture of this, I creating a fresh set of wireframes across all key page templates using Adobe xD. This gave us a solid foundation to iterate over until we were able to achieve a high fidelity prototype.

Once this clear view of the revised website had been achieved, I utilised a “bottom-up” approach starting with the devops updates including generating a fresh instance of SilverStripe and configuring AWS hosting and GitHub integration to provide a smooth local development workflow. From there, I refined and extended the existing relationships and controllers to facilitate the new features. Lastly, I moved to the front-end to and feature implementation (see core features below).
