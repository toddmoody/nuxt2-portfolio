RFI Fusion is a collaborative tool designed to streamline the communication between teams during projects. Project stakeholders can easily invite core project members, engage with each other, follow-up outstanding tasks, upload important documents, plus many other key features - all to help ensure a smooth project workflow.

At the core, RFI Fusion solves a problem many constructon related businesses face which is the B2B "Request For Information" process very time-consuming, cumbersome, and typicaly 100% paper-based. It's estimated that approximately 1% of construction related business costs are related to arduous RFI processes.

Initially prototyped and released at an MVP application for internal usage, we're excited to be nearing the commercial BETA release of RFI Fusion!

### Stack & approach

</div>
<div class="project__long__description__content">

I managed the design, prototyping and full-stack development of this application. I could see the potential in this application and I wanted to utilise a technology stack that would not only meet the immediate needs of the application but would also provide the flexibility required for feature releases in subsequent project phases. Additionally, if the application got larger than I was able to manage as a freelance developer, it was critical that code to be well documented and as maintainable as possible in order to able to easily brief out features to external developers. Therefore, I decided to use Vue.js as the front-end framework along with Nuxt.js to take advantage of Server Side Rendering with the back-end developed in Laravel 8. The entire solution is hosted on AWS including file uploads utilising S3 buckets.

### A challenge to overcome

</div>
<div class="project__long__description__content">

With a project of this scale there have been various challenges along the way. I think using an agile process and staggering deployments has really helped keep the evolution of the application both efficient and effective - as has the underlying technology stack and the development workflow I have established (incl. auto-deploy from my GitHub master branch). One recent challenge has been allowing individual companies to control the level of visibility they have across the application. Typically this would be quite straightforward but given the core application has been designed for communication between companies (i.e. being as viral as possible) it has been challenging to isolate these preferences and ensure the flow remains optimal across the front-end. Luckily, I had previously built a commmunications preference center for controlling email notifications that I was able to extend an isolate to the group that has privillages to control the companies visibility.
